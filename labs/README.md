## Laboratory work #1: Introduction to Mininet/mininet_intro

The main purpose of the work is to deploy in a virtualization system
(for example, in VirtualBox) mininet, familiarity with the basic commands 
for working with Mininet through the command line and through the graphical interface.

## Laboratory work #2: Measurement and testing of network bandwidth. Interactive experiment/iperf3-part1

The main purpose of the work is to get acquainted with a tool for measuring
network bandwidth in real time — iPerf3, as well
as to gain skills in conducting an interactive experiment to measure
the bandwidth of a simulated network in a Mini net environment.

## Laboratory work #3: Measurement and testing of network bandwidth. Reproducible experiment/iperf3-part2

The main purpose of the work is to get acquainted with a tool for measuring
network bandwidth in real time — iPerf3, as well
as to gain skills in conducting a reproducible experiment to measure
the bandwidth of a simulated network in a Mini net environment.

## Laboratory work #4: Emulation and measurement of delays in global networks/netem latency

The main purpose of the work is to get acquainted with NETEM, a tool for
testing application performance in a virtual network, as well
as to gain skills in conducting interactive and reproducible experiments to measure latency 
and its jitter (jitter) in a simulated network in a Mininet environment.
